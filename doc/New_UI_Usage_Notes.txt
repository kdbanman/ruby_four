General
=======
- Engine will have higher coupling with the view classes
- Only WindowManager should use the set_on_destory method of the window classes
- Only WindowManager should use the start method of the window classes
- Only WindowManager should use the kill method of the window classes

- Engine or other controllers should use "set_head_kill_rest", "replace_current_window", "open_window" to open new windows

- WindowManager.start is blocking, all initalization should be done and reliant on call backs after this.

- Push information messages to the user with WindowManager.push_information_dialog (msg)
