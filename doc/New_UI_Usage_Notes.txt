General
=======
- Engine will have higher coupling with the view classes
- Only WindowManager should use the set_on_destory method of the window classes
- Only WindowManager should use the start of the window classes

- The kill method of the window classes can and should be used by classes other than WindowManager
	- If a window is to be open after another closes, submit it to the window manager first and then kill the original window

- Engine or other controllers should only open windows using the WindowManager.open_window method

- WindowManager.start is blocking, all initalization should be done and reliant on call backs after this.

Game Screen Notes
=================

Listeners that should be subscribed to:
- On Close (set_close_listener): Called before the window is destroyed
- Column Selected (set_column_selected_listener): Called when a column on the game board is selected
